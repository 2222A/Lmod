Notes on Settarg talk

* Goals
** Make software devel easier by switch to different kinds of builds (dbg/opt etc)
** Create Env. Vars. to control type of software build
** Manage $PATH
** Report status in titlebar
** Integrate with Lmod!!

* History
** Worked on a system with different architectures
** Wanted to support dbg/opt as well.

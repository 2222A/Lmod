Notes on Settarg talk

* Goals
** Make software devel easier by switch to different kinds of builds (dbg/opt etc)
** Create Env. Vars. to control type of software build
** Manage $PATH
** Report status in titlebar
** Integrate with Lmod!!

* Show examples
** dbg/opt/mdbg -> $TARG
** ml -impi;    -> $TARG
** ml -intel;   -> $TARG
** Built xalt w/ explicit TARG usage

* History
** Worked on a system with different architectures
** Wanted to support dbg/opt as well.
** Didn't want to have make clobber and start over everytime
   
* What are the important TARG Vars:
** TARG: OBJ/_x86_64_opt_gcc-9.3.0_mpich-3.3.2
** TARG_BUILD_SCENARIO: dbg
** TARG_COMPILER_FAMILY: gcc
** TARG_MPI_FAMILY: mpich
** TARG_COMPILER gcc-9.3.0
** TARG_MPI   mpich-3.3.2

* Explain about how $PATH works
** Relative paths are DYNAMIC!


* Example w/ Makefile
** Show contrib/settarg/make_example
*** make -f Makefile.simple
*** make 
** Show what happens when changing compiler, dbg, etc.

* Show TARG under ~/w/dao/mgf
** Talk about .settarg.lua

* settarg --report

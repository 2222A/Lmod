Lmod Hands-ons Tutorial:  Chose your own topic

We have 5 different Topics for you to chose from.  We have provided a
USB thumb drive for you to take with you.  On the thumb drive is a
copy of the Virtual Box software for Windows, Mac OS X, Ubuntu and
Fedora and a VM for you to run.

Please install the virtual box software appropriate for your laptop.
Then invoke the Virtual Box Software on your laptop and "import" (from
the file menu) the XALT-Lmod.ova Virtual Machine (aka. VM).

Once it has been imported, start the VM.  The user account is xalt and
the password is also xalt.

Once you have logged in you are free to try out one or more of the
topics.  We will be around for you to ask questions.

Notes for SC Conf on Lmod, rpm etc.

* Major concepts:
** Software apps/libraries are being created and updated constantly.
** This means that there will be old and new version of that software.
** Users will need access new version for features or bug fixes and older versions for stability.
** Hence the need for providing multiple version of packages and easy switching between versions.

* Use of a package manager to allow for easy installation of both software and modulefiles.
** Re-shooting of nodes?
** 

* Use Environment Modules make different version of packages easily available to users.
** Use modules instead of softenv?
** Users want access to a resource/package
** Some Users need to moved to newer versions of software.
** Provide users with a default set of modules.


* Hierarchy
** Application and libraries must be compiled and linked with same compiler.
** In the HPC world, Application which which use Parallel libraries must be compiled and linked 
   with the correct MPI - compiler pairing.
** For parallel libraries that means multiple versions. 
   For three compilers and three mpi implementations means 9 different
   builds of the same version of the parallel library.

* Flat versus Hierarchical
** names like parallelLib_1.2.4-mpiLib_2.4-compiler_12.2
** In flat system all version will be seen:  Too many version, No guidiance on what works.
** Hierarchical layout means that you can only see the modules 


* Hierarchical problems
** While users can only load matching libraries and applications for the compiler-mpi pairing.
** Care must be taken when swapping compilers.

Here are the steps required to produce the list of users that have
used particular modules.

A) On Ranger go to /share/tacc_admin/moduleUsage,  On Longhorn go to
   /share/tacc_admin/moduleUsage.  On Lonestar go to
   /home1/tacc_admin/moduleUsage.

B) Run grep on modules.list to get the absolute path of the modules
   you are interested in.  As an example suppose you want to find the
   list of users still using petsc 2.3.3 as well as slepc 2.3.3 etc



      $ grep 2.3.3 modules.list > petsc_2.3.3.list


C) Must add lmod programs to PATH.  Try doing:

      $ module load lmod

   If that does not work then do:

      $ export PATH=/opt/apps/lmod/lmod/libexec:$PATH

D) Run "reportUsers" to find out what modules are being used.


      $ reportUsers -f petsc_2.3.3.list --m2u=petsc.m2u --u2m=petsc.u2m *.csv

   This command will take several minutes.  When it is done there will
   be two files: petsc.m2u which lists the particular module and the
   users of that module; and petsc.u2m which lists users and the
   particular modules they used.


E) If you just wish to know the number of users of modules and not
   which one then one can do:


      $ processModuleUsage -f modules.list *.csv > ModulesUsed.txt

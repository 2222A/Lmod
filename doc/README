Version 2.13

This version of Lmod provide support for the "family" command.  The family command makes it easy to
prevent user from loading two version of the same "family".  For example on our system, most users
should not have two compilers loaded at the same time.  To support this feature, all you need do is
add the following to all the compiler modulefiles:

For TCL modulefiles do:

  family "compiler"

For lua module files do:

  family("compiler")

The word in quotes is case-sensitive so "Compiler" and "compiler" and "COMPILER" are all different.

You can have different families.  So we currently have a "compiler" family and a "MPI" family.

Expert users really want two of the same family loaded at the same time can set the environment
variable "LMOD_EXPERT" to "1".  This will bypass the test for them.

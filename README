Lmod Version 5.3.1:
Feature:
   a) added tool "sh_to_modulefile" to convert a bash shell script into
      a lua based shell script.:

   $ sh_to_modulefile -o intel-14.0.2.lua  /a/intel/bin/iccvars.sh intel64

   note that you can give argument to the shell script.
   

Lmod Version 5.3:
Features:
   a) Searching for avail, spider and list are case-insensitive.
      Lua regexp searching now requires a "-r" option
   b) The modulefile function isloaded() takes atleast, between and latest:
        isloaded(atleast("Foo","1.2"))
   c) Spider searching improved.  When an exact match is found Lmod reports 
      other possible matches:

     R: R/2.1.5
       Other possible modules matches:
          PrgEnv, greenlet, parmetis, r


Bug Fix:
   a) Quotes inside a whatis or help message are properly escaped.
   b) Better handling of nested modules by fixing load order.

Lmod Version 5.2.4:
Feature:
  a) Lmod can be configured to ignore TCL module files.

Lmod Version 5.2.3:
Bug Fixes:
  a) Prereq now works with a version.
  b) The function "always_load" works with show.
  c) The "make install" now works and doesn't complain about not being a git repository.

Lmod Version 5.2:
Features:
  a) Modulefiles can mix load commands and setenv's and still be saved and restored.
  b) In Lua modulefiles you can modify load function behavior:
        load(atleast("a","1.2"))       -- load module "a" with version 1.2
                                       -- or higher.
        load(between("b","1.2","1.4")  -- load module "b" with version between
                                       -- 1.2 and 1.4.
        load(latest("c"))              -- load latest version of "c", ignore
                                       -- marked default.

     This only works in Lua module files, and works on all load functions:
     load, always_load.
  c) In Lua modulefiles you can modify prereq function behavior:
        prereq(atleast("a","1.2"))      -- Module "a" must be version 1.2
                                        -- or higher.
        prereq(between("b","1.2","1.4") -- Module "b" must be version between
                                        -- 1.2 and 1.4.
        prereq(latest("c"))             -- Module "c" must be latest possible

     This only works in Lua module files, and works on all prereq functions:
     prereq, prereq_any.


Lmod Version 5.1.5:
Bug Fixes:
  a) Changes in the terse output for avail and spider.  A directory
     that contains module versions has a trailing "/"
  b) The environment that a module sees (and only in that environment).
     Lmod defines the following variables shown with their current values:
        LMOD_VERSION:          5.1.5
        LMOD_VERSION_MAJOR:    5
        LMOD_VERSION_MINOR:    1
        LMOD_VERSION_SUBMINOR: 5

  c) Module function to do version comparison (only for lua based modulefiles):

       if (convertToCanonical(LmodVersion()) > convertToCanonical("5.0")) then
          -- Do something that is only valid for Lmod 5.0 or greater
       end

    The function convertToCanonical() knows how to deal with alpha, beta,
    and rc version and the function LmodVersion() returns the current
    version of Lmod.


Lmod Version 5.1.1:
Bug Fixes and internal improvements
  a) Lmod can now find all the dot module files.
  b) Fixed bug with inherit()
  c) Settarg nolonger tries to control all TARG_* variables.
  d) Better handling of "Rebuild cache ..." line.
  e) Improvements to the execute function.
  f) "module --mt" prints the module table
  g) "settarg --stt" prints the settarg table.

Lmod Version 5.1.0:

Version 5.1.0 now supports the following new features:

a) module --ignore_cache which tells Lmod to ignore the cache even if it
   exists.

b) module --config reports how lmod was configured.

c) Lmod no longer walks the directory tree on command like list and
   unload.

d) The pager is now used only when TERM is defined and stderr is
   connected to a tty (this includes a pty: pseudo tty).

e) The system startup scripts (init/profile, and init/cshrc) that
   are usually linked to modules.sh and modules.csh in /etc/profile.d
   contains now modulefiles: lmod and settarg.  Please consider using
   this as defined or moving these module files into your normal
   MODULEPATH.

f) Support for settarg has been added for Bash, Zsh and Tcsh users.

g) See README.old for features added in earlier versions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Settarg?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Settarg is new module that accesses a new tool to dynamically and
automatically updates "$TARG" and a host of other environment
variables. These new environment variables encapsulate the state of
the modules loaded.

                        *** NOTE ****

Please note that settarg feature is optional and is implemented as a
module.  If and only if the settarg module is loaded you get the new
behavior.  You can load and unload the settarg module at will to turn
on and off these new features.  Settarg does work for tcsh users as
well a feat not to be scoffed at! Unfortunately regular csh is
missing necessary features for it to work.

                        *** NOTE ****


For example, if I have the gcc/4.7.2 module loaded
and the new settarg module loaded I get the following variables
defined in my environment.


   TARG=OBJ/_x86_64_06_1a_gcc-4.7.3
   TARG_COMPILER=gcc-4.7.3
   TARG_COMPILER_FAMILY=gcc
   TARG_MACH=x86_64_06_1a

If I change my compiler to intel/13.1.0, these variables change to:

   TARG=OBJ/_x86_64_06_1a_intel-13.1.0
   TARG_COMPILER=intel-13.1.0
   TARG_COMPILER_FAMILY=intel
   TARG_MACH=x86_64_06_1a

This was designed to help me as a developer of software applications
where I am constantly changing compilers, mpi stacks and other
modules. These variable are used to set the compiler flags and other
things in my Makefiles to control how my application is built. In my
case $TARG the directory is where the the objects, libraries and
executables are placed during the build process. It easy to have the
title bar reflect the dynamic state of your modules. You can
abbreviate items mentioned in the titlebar.  I have found this
combination of settarg and Lmod to be a powerful development
tool. Even if this workflow is not yours, you may find parts of this
useful.

For a more complete tour of settargs features see:
contrib/settarg/Settarg.txt and the Make example in
contrib/settarg/make_example.

Lmod 8.0+
   (8.0.1)  * Change to use AC_SEARCH_LIBS for tcl, tcl8.8, tcl8.7, tcl8.6  tcl8.5 to accomodate SUSE's decision
              not to include libtcl.so to point to the current tcl implementation.
            * issue #401: change tcl2lua.c to copy output string into an internal buffer. This avoids problems 
              found with some tcl interpreter (8.5.13 and earlier.
            * Issue with tcl2lua.tcl not handling modulefiles writing to stderr.  All output from the tcl modulefiles
              now go through $g_outputA.

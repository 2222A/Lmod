Changes to Lmod that haven't been released to sourceforge.

a) Lmod now obeys LMOD_REDIRECT (or module --redirect)
   when using the --terse option.  This means that if
   LMOD_REDIRECT is set then module -t av will go to
   stdout instead of stderr.

b) Lmod now does not resolve any symlinks when doing
   "module use <path>"

c) LMOD_REDIRECT is now reported with --config option.

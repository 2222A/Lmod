Changes that have not yet been made available on sourceforge

Features:
  a) All the Lmod programs now resolve any symlinks to the
     actual program before adding to the Lua's package.path
     and package.cpath.

Bug Fixes:
  a) The command "savelist" now only reports collections that
     match $LMOD_SYSTEM_NAME (install of all collections)
  b) A collection name now CANNOT have `.' in its name.
